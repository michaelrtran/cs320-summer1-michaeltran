Please implement a function of the name quiz02_03
that takes one list xs of integers and returns a sublist
consisting of every element in xs that is greater than all
the elements after it. For instance, if xs = [3,1,2,1,1],
then the sublist is [3,2,1]; if xs = [5,4,1,2,3], then the
sublist is [5,4,3].
