//
Given a list of integers xs, list_grouping(xs)
returns a list of pairs (n, x) where n indicates
the number of times x occurs in xs; for each x in
xs, there must be a pair (n, x) for some n in the
returned list.
//
For instance,
list_grouping([1,2]) = [[1,1], [1,2]]
list_grouping([1,2,2,2,1]) = [[2,1], [3,2]]
list_grouping([1,2,1,2,3]) = [[2,1], [2,2], [1,3]]
//
In order to receive full credit, your implementation
should be able to handle a list containing 1M elements
in less than 10 seconds (mine can do it in less than
two seconds)

IF YOU WANT TO SORT A LIST, YOU MUST IMPLEMENT
SOME SORTING FUNCTION ON YOUR OWN. Your implementation
is not allowed to make use of library functions except
those in the library for this class.

Some testing code:

val nxs =
list_grouping(list_map(list_fromto(0, N), fn i => N-i))

Some testing code:

Your implementation needs to be efficient to pass the
following test:
val N = 1000000
val nxs = list_grouping(int1_map_list(N, fn i => N-i))
